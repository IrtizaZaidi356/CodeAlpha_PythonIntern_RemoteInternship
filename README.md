## **Project No# 01: Text-Based Hangman Game in Python**

#### **Introduction:**
  - The Text-Based Hangman Game is a simple yet engaging Python project designed to entertain and challenge players. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and players attempt to guess the word one letter at a time.

#### **Features:**
  - **Word Selection:** The game selects a random word from a list of options, ensuring variety in each playthrough.
  - **Guessing Mechanism:** Players input one letter at a time to uncover the hidden word. The game tracks guessed letters and displays the current state of the word after each guess.
  - **Limits on Incorrect Guesses:** To add suspense, the game sets a limit on the number of incorrect guesses allowed (default: 6). Players must strategize to reveal the word before reaching the maximum attempts.

#### **Usage:**
  - Players are welcomed to the game with a friendly message.
  - They input their guesses, receiving feedback on correctness and the remaining attempts.
  - The game continues until the word is guessed correctly or the player exhausts their attempts.

#### **Conclusion:**
  - The Text-Based Hangman Game is an entertaining project that showcases foundational Python concepts such as randomization, input handling, and conditional statements. It provides a hands-on experience in creating interactive programs and is suitable for beginners and those looking to reinforce their Python skills. Players can enjoy the challenge of guessing words while exploring the world of text-based gaming. Feel free to customize the code, add more words, or tweak the difficulty level for an enhanced gaming experience.
